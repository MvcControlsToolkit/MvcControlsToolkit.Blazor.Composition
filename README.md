# MvcControlsToolkit.Blazor.Composition
Composition Example for the Blazor Composition Toolkit

This repository contains an example of usage of the Blazor Composition Toolkit, 
a micro-frontend framework for Blazor.

The Blazor Composition Toolkit allows micro-frontend dlls to be organized in modules
that may be downloaded from endpoints as soon as they are needed, that is either when a page 
they contain is required or when a named dynamic component they implement is required.

At moment Blazor Composition Toolkit is in rc1. When it will be publicly availbale we will post
here more information. Anyway, interested readers, may contact us on GitHub or
with  [this contact form](http://www.mvc-controls.com/company/Home/Contact)
